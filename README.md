## React Fundamental Concepts Used

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Created reusable components such as Navbar, Footer, ProductCard, etc.
2. **State Management**: Utilized React's `useState` for local state and Context API for global state management.
3. **Lifecycle Methods**: Managed side effects with `useEffect`, such as fetching and filtering data.
4. **Routing**: Implemented `react-router-dom` for navigation and dynamic routing across pages.
5. **Hooks**: Used hooks like `useContext`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation` for managing state and navigation.
